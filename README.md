#  üß† Stroke Prediction

This is a project to predict stroke disease based on variables, such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, ever married, work type, residence type, avg glucose level, bmi, smoking status.

This project aims to utilize different machine learning classification methods to analyze the dataset and provide insights.

The script is implemented on jupyter notebook with Python programming language.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Install Instructions

For new users, we recommend you download Anaconda. It is a distribution platform that allows you to develop applications for data science and machine learning. With one installation, you can access Jupyter notebook connected to Python conveniently. You can download Anaconda via this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).

After finishing the installation, you can access the Jupyter notebook via Anaconda navigator application.

### Package Installation
Generally, Anaconda already installed the packages we use in the project. However, if you have installed Python in a different way. You can install the required packages as below.

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn (aka scikit-learn)


To install the package, please use the command [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and run it on a command prompt or a terminal, depending on your operating system.

Take numpy for example:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Running Time

Running time actually depends on many conditions relating to the specification of your computer. We have run the code on two different environments and recorded the running time in the table below.
| System | Running Time |
|--|--|
| MAC <br> Apple M1 chip 8-core CPU <br> RAM 8 GB| 8 mins |
| Windows <br> Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz <br> RAM 8 GB | 35 mins |
